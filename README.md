# iitc-offle
This is a plugin for [IITC](https://github.com/IITC-CE/ingress-intel-total-conversion/ "Ingress intel total conversion"), popular user script for [Ingress](https://www.ingress.com/) players. 


It shows local cached portals location on map, even if zoomed out.
If you have uniques plugin installed, it shows also uniqueness of the portal.
If you have keys plugin installed, it shows number of your keys for each portal.

Currently number of visible portals is limited to 2000 due to Leflet performace problems with many markers.

If you don't see any portals, zoom-in.

The plugin also supports export of the saved portal lists in JSON and KML format. 
You can use JSON format for backup of your portal database since the plugin supports also JSON import.
